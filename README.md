# H2-Ammonia Simulator

A techno-economic simulation tool for green and blue ammonia production, developed as part of the **MirrorMind** project ‚Äî a next-generation AI framework designed to support strategic thinking, scenario modeling, and techno-economic validation in the energy transition space.

---

## üîç Purpose

This simulator performs reverse calculations to estimate the necessary investments, renewable capacity (solar/wind), and electrolyzer scaling to produce a **target quantity of low-carbon ammonia** (e.g., 100,000 tons per year).

It is designed for early-stage feasibility studies, investment modeling, and policy support in hydrogen-ammonia value chains.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Reverse computation based on a fixed annual NH‚ÇÉ production target
- Optimizes solar/wind/ESS ratio based on LCOA minimization
- Hydrogen buffer tank sizing to ensure minimum 60% uptime for ammonia plants
- Full-grid or hybrid electricity scenarios
- LCOA (Levelized Cost of Ammonia) breakdown
- IRR-driven revenue modeling (planned)
- Exportable PDF reports (coming soon)

## üìê Assumptions & Data Sources

All default values and formulas are based on international hydrogen and ammonia techno-economic benchmarks:

| Parameter | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Hydrogen energy density | 33.33 kWh/kg | IEA (2022) |
| Hydrogen mass per Nm¬≥ | 0.08988 kg | Standard ISO value |
| Electrolyzer types | ALC (AWE), PEM, SOEC | Typical system specs |
| Solar/Wind CF | 20~35% (input) | IRENA, regional data |
| CapEx/Opex for NH‚ÇÉ plant | Input-driven | User-defined or market average |

## üìä Use Cases

- Project finance & investment planning
- Pre-FEED techno-economic assessment
- Policy simulations (RE/IRR/carbon targets)
- Export competitiveness analysis
